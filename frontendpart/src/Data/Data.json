      "body": "I've just started exploring click, and wholeheartedly love it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nOne thing that made the experience a bit frustrating was the API reference. Currently, in some places, it omits descriptions of the arguments of some of the decorators. For example, with [`click.argument`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/#click.argument), it just says the type is `Any` without telling where to look for the actual description:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6691643/167310684-18074b81-3932-4bc8-b7e4-5af48cf8f8b2.png)\r\n\r\nI guess it's because the underlying argument class is customizable, but for the default usecase it would be nice to have a reference to the default.\r\n\r\nClicking on the reference to [`click.Argument`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/#click.Argument) doesn't reveal much either:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6691643/167310805-d624ec5c-728a-4f73-9f72-43c7a86ee9c9.png)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the description of `attrs` pointed to their actual reference: [`click.Parameter`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/#click.Parameter) in case of `argument` and `option` decorators.\r\n\r\nThere's already a precedent for this in the docs - [`click.Group`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/#click.Group):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6691643/167312103-295a3eee-42c7-436a-a2e0-cbbaebb001b0.png)\r\n",

      "body": "I looked a bit and I could not find it, but I wonder if there is a possibility to determine if any of the definitions of the click commands changed since last time we run the check.\r\n\r\nThis woudl be extremely useful for generating documentation automatically as part of pre-commit/CI workflow. We are doing that in Apache Airflow, resulting in embedded SVG images like this : https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/BREEZE.rst#installation\r\n\r\nCurrently the (small) problem we have is that we always try to regenerate those SVG images in CI and we fail pre-commit if the generated images are different. This allows us to make sure that we have not forgotten to regenerate and SVG image when any parameter changes. And it works moslty fine (we've made sure that terminal size is always the same when we generate the help so re-geenerated images are the same). The problem is when output format of the SVG changes (as it happened in rich 12.4.0 for example) - because then the generated SVG images will be slightly different. We do not really want to pin rich and upgrade it manually as this is just a development tool in this case, but this is what we ended up for now.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution to that would be to get some kind of unique hash that would only change if any of the parameters, their help, type etc. changes - and otherwise being stable. Then we could implement such workflow (automatically):\r\n\r\n* Check if current hash of all options/commands/flags has not changed from the last one committed together with images. Skip the rest if it did not.\r\n* Generate images only if hash is different\r\n* Store the changed hash\r\n* Commit both - generate SVG and hash together\r\n\r\nThis way we could actually only run the SVG generation if we know any of the options changed (the problem currently is that we generate it every time any of the \"dev\" python code changes which is quite excessive - but since `click` annotations are part of the code, that's simplest.\r\n\r\nIs there such a feature already available and I missed it ? Or if not - do the maintainers think it's a good idea? I am willing to contribute a PR for that - I might be able to analyse the code and find out how to do and maybe need a little guidance, but I would love to know if that seems like a good idea.\r\n",

We use psutil to detect the parent shell, and when that is bash, we emit these strings.\r\n\r\nWould this be of interest to include in click? If so, I'd be happy to add it and document it. I'm just not sure if it is too bash-specific to be in click, and also pretty sure the psutil dependency would be too much to ask.",

As such some have been skipped.\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change. Tests should fail without the change.\r\n- [ ] Add or update relevant docs, in the docs folder and in code.\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.rst` summarizing the change and linking to the issue.\r\n- [ ] Add `.. versionchanged::` entries in any relevant code docs.\r\n- [x] Run `pre-commit` hooks and fix any issues.\r\n- [x] Run `pytest` and `tox`, no tests failed.\r\n",

      "body": "I am working on updating to Click 8 in https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/pull/11361 and wanted to make `windows_expand_args=True` default for all my uses and have a single place to apply any other adjustments I need at that level.  I wrote a custom subclass of `Group` as below to achieve that, as well as a similar subclass of `Command`.  The issue is that when I hint that only my `_Command` subclass should be passed mypy complains due to the variance of `Dict`.  Modifying `click.Group.__init__()` to accept `Mapping[str, Command]` instead of `Dict[str, Command]` resolves the issue.

      "body": "Thanks for this great project!\r\nPerhaps it's just me who feels that it is rather cumbersome mark a single parameter as deprecated (the closet I found was https://stackoverflow.com/a/50402799). Is there perhaps a more official method to mark a single parameter as deprecated?\r\nThat would somewhat be similar to https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1507.\r\n\r\nPossible scenarios:\r\n- the parameter was renamed (e.g. a previous version was using `--name` as option, but now a dev want's to make sure it's the `--sur-name`.\r\n- the parameter is not needed anymore\r\n\r\nPerhaps as an example consider:\r\n```\r\nimport click\r\n\r\n@click.command()\r\n@click.option('--count', default=1, help='Number of greetings.')\r\n@click.option('--name', prompt='Your name',\r\n              help='The person to greet.')\r\ndef hello(count, name):\r\n    \"\"\"Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times.\"\"\"\r\n    for x in range(count):\r\n        click.echo(f\"Hello {name}!\")\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    hello()\r\n```\r\nand I want to rename `--count` to `--greetings-count`.\r\nHowever I don't want to remove  `--count`  instantly, instead when users use `--count` prompt a message that they should use the new `--greetings-count`. The usage of `--count` and `--greetings-count` should be forbidden.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nToday I was testing one flask service which is using flask-cors and pytest-cov and behind the curtains these ones are using click. \r\nWe're using pipenv to install this service and we've noticed one of the subdependencies,\r\ncolorama is being marked to be windows specific in the Pipfile.lock, ie:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"colorama\": {\r\n            \"hashes\": [\r\n                \"sha256:5941b2b48a20143d2267e95b1c2a7603ce057ee39fd88e7329b0c292aa16869b\",\r\n                \"sha256:9f47eda37229f68eee03b24b9748937c7dc3868f906e8ba69fbcbdd3bc5dc3e2\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"markers\": \"platform_system == 'Windows'\",\r\n            \"version\": \"==0.4.4\"\r\n        },\r\n```\r\nI've tried to understand what was the rationale behind this and it seems is because click is marking it as windows dependecy, ie:\r\n[https://github.com/pallets/click/pull/1784/commits](https://github.com/pallets/click/pull/1784/commits)\r\n\r\nThis looks like a bug. Colorama [is a cross-platform dependency](https://github.com/tartley/colorama/blob/master/setup.py#L53) so the fact you're marking it as windows specific it's a bug\r\nthat will prevent from generating cross-platform Pipfile.lock when using tools such as pipenv. So because of that the library won't be installed in CI envs unless flagging colorama with a \"fake\" marker, which it's a workaround in the first place.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

For me, the output of `shutil.get_terminal_size()` is `os.terminal_size(columns=210, lines=44)`.  But click is wrapping all text to 80 characters and does not respond to resizes of the terminal before or during the program's execution.\r\n\r\nThis is a little jarring and it would be nice if this could either dynamically resize or offer a way to manually set it.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.9\r\n- Click version: 8.1.2\r\n",

      "body": "Description\r\n========\r\nMore often than none you want to add few options to a CMD such that at most one of them can be set with a value. This ability can be achieved by setting a group of mutually exclusive options.\r\n\r\nSuggested API\r\n==========\r\n\r\nHere's a suggested API for this ability\r\n```python\r\nimport click\r\n\r\n@click.command()\r\n@click.mutually_exclusive(\r\n    click.option(\"-a\", type=int, help=\"This is a\"),\r\n    click.option(\"-b\", type=str, help=\"This is b\"),\r\n    click.option(\"-c\", is_flag=True, default=False, help=\"This is c\"),\r\n    required=True,\r\n)\r\ndef my_command(a, b, c):\r\n    click.echo(f\"{a=}, {b=}, {c=}\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"main\":\r\n   my_command()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we define three mutually exclusive options: `-a`, `-b` and `-c`. With setting `required=True` we determine that at least one of them should be set (default is `False`).\r\n\r\nThe following should be printed:\r\n```\r\n>> my-command -a 5\r\na=5, b=None, c=False\r\n>> my-command -b hello\r\na=None, b=hello, c=False\r\n>> my-command -c\r\na=None, b=None, c=True\r\n>> my-command -a 5 -b hello\r\nError: The following options cannot be both set: \"-a\", \"-b\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though this ability has been suggested multiple times over the years (see #257, #509, #1137), it was rejected every time. I do believe that this is something *Click* users should really benefit from. If you choose to approve this suggestion, I will try to implement it.",

      "body": "When click exits, it [raises a RuntimeError](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/main/src/click/core.py#L685-L687) even when everything worked ok. Hence, if I wrap a call to a click command inside a `try/except`, this will be picked up as an exception even though nothing went wrong.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem with ipython, which catches all exceptions and does some custom handling of them. What happens appears to be: ipython [executes the code](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/7.32.0/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L3524), click raises the `RuntimeError`, ipython [catches it](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/7.32.0/IPython/core/ultratb.py#L1108) but because there's no actual error message or traceback, ipython seems to get confused and generates even more exceptions.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why click raises an exception even when the program ran ok and `code == 0`? [I changed the click behaviour very slightly to no longer do so](https://github.com/pallets/click/compare/main...AntonyMilneQB:main) and it fixes this completely, but I'm guessing there's a reason click doesn't do this already?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Put the [README's simple example](https://github.com/pallets/click#a-simple-example) into hello.py\r\n2. Start an ipython session using `ipython`\r\n3. Enter `from hello import hello; hello()`\r\n4. Command executes ok (even with arguments, like `hello([\"--count\", 3])` but will afterwards produce the following exception ([see full traceback](https://gist.github.com/AntonyMilneQB/805da60db4d15fe7a41951633d95ca74)):\r\n```\r\nERROR:root:Internal Python error in the inspect module.\r\nBelow is the traceback from this internal error.\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/antony_milne/miniconda3/envs/spaceflights/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1065, in main\r\n    ctx.exit()\r\n  File \"/Users/antony_milne/miniconda3/envs/spaceflights/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 687, in exit\r\n    raise Exit(code)\r\nclick.exceptions.Exit: 0\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNote: that `ipython -m hello` works ok, as does the above flow when using `python`. It's only when running an interactive ipython session that click's RuntimeError is problematic.\r\n\r\n### What should happen\r\nNo traceback from ipython.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n- Python version: 3.8.13\r\n- Click version: 8.1.2\r\n",

This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.7</h2>\n<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596\">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527\">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make caching more verbose <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650\">#650</a></li>\n<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701\">#701</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w\">CVE-2020-15228</a>.

It's super seamless, and there are no transaction fees unless the entity making the donation is a business.  It takes about 5 minutes total to sign up.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sponsors is all you need\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\nThere's a LOT more information on customization available here:\r\n* [Announcing GitHub Sponsors: a new way to contribute to open source | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/)\r\n* [Getting started with GitHub Sponsors | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2020-03-24-getting-started-with-github-sponsors/)\r\n* [FAQ with the GitHub Sponsors team | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2019-06-12-faq-with-the-github-sponsors-team/)\r\n* [New sponsors-only repositories, custom amounts, and more  | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship Made Easy\r\n\r\nIt's ridiculously simple.  GitHub already has your payment info, 0% fees for non-companies, and it takes exactly 3 clicks to donate.  You don't need to enter ANY data other than how much you want to donate, one-time or recurring, and that's all.\r\n\r\nIf you set up Sponsors for the Organization (`pallets`) you can configure whether your sponsors show up on the right side of the Github landing page.\r\n\r\n### Exactly Two Screenshots\r\n\r\nIt's really this easy for people to donate, AND it shows up in a standard, expected place on your repos!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"999\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-11 at 5 15 04 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111640/157857220-dada0a77-a071-4542-98eb-0b8787d71359.png\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1019\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-11 at 5 15 24 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111640/157857273-b300fcaa-86f7-4cb4-9ff6-a81c965e7a6c.png\">\r\n",

This way `Choice(choices=somedict.keys())` is valid.\r\n\r\n- fixes #2211\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] (n/a) Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change.

      "body": "Added a new ability to be able to create a choice parameter type from enum class.\r\n\r\nHow does it differ from `Choice`? Enums are the way of python to allow only a finite number of values to be accepted in a given scenario. It seems logical to me that click should offer a `Choice`-like parameter type that gets its values from an enum and returns an enum.\r\n\r\nNow, using `click.EnumChoice`, one can create a `Choice`-like parameter that returns an enum instead of a string.\r\nMoreover, once you add a new value to your enum class, it will automatically update as a valid choice for the paramater type.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change. Tests should fail without the change.\r\n- [ ] Add or update relevant docs, in the docs folder and in code.\r\n- [ ] Add an entry in `CHANGES.rst` summarizing the change and linking to the issue.\r\n- [ ] Add `.. versionchanged::` entries in any relevant code docs.\r\n- [X] Run `pre-commit` hooks and fix any issues.\r\n- [X] Run `pytest` and `tox`, no tests failed.\r\n",

Please use more specific and flexible syntax to specify a PyPy version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        python-version:\n        - 'pypy-2.7' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 2.7\n        - 'pypy-3.8' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 3.8\n        - 'pypy-3.8-v7.3.8' # Python 3.8 and PyPy 7.3.8\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See more usage examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python#specifying-a-pypy-version\">documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Update primary and restore keys for pip</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/303\">include a version of python in restore and primary cache keys for pip</a>. Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a> dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when you want to override current behaviour and use different file for hash generation (for example requirements-dev.txt). This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Caching pip dependencies:</h3>\n<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n  with:\n    python-version: '3.9'\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "body": "First, thanks for making an awesome tool! Click made knocking together a CLI for my masters work trivial. \r\n\r\nThese documentation questions are an effort to clarify some of the language in the [setuptools](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/setuptools/) and [shell completion](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/shell-completion/?highlight=tab%20complete#enabling-completion) sections, to reduce friction for new users like me. \r\n\r\n1. Though **Shell Completion** depends on users installing through a setuptools entrypoint, and refers to the **Setuptools Integration** docs, the terminology is not aligned between the two sets of examples. **Scripts in Packages** refers to the package `yourpackage`, a subpackage `scripts`, a module `yourscript`, and a click command `cli`. Shell Completion refers to `PROG_NAME`, \"the executable name in uppercase...\". Does `PROG_NAME` map to the the name of the package `yourscript`, the entrypoint `yourscript`, the command `cli`, or something else entirely? Clarification of exactly what the \"executable name\" is here would be very helpful.\r\n2. In the **Scripts in Packages** example, it is unclear that the `console_scripts` key is a \"default\" value, and not something package-specific. For users who have worked with entrypoints in setup.py before, this is probably obvious, but for newcomers there's no visual way to differentiate \"standard\" values from semantically meaningful ones in this example. A single-sentence note clarifying would help.\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Click version: 8\r\n",

      "body": "Click currently uses a modified copy of optparse to parse command line arguments. In order to use it, Click creates an entire optparse class structure mirroring the structure that users write, which seems like unnecessary overhead. Click also goes beyond what optparse was intended for, which means there's a lot of working around how optparse works. There are old issues about the processing being an issue, and newer features are also affected because it's hard to manage whether the parser or the processing will get values or raise errors.\r\n\r\nMost of the code in our parser copy isn't even the actual parsing code, it's all the optparse equivalent objects to Click's objects. I've started working on a new parser that works directly from the Click objects, instead of constructing a separate parser structure.\r\n\r\nThe following open issues are related, although I'm not guaranteeing that they'll all be immediately fixed with the rewrite. Some of them are also affected by the processing pipeline, which happens after parsing.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/473\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/590\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/602\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/611\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/619\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/680\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/742\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1269\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1279\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1322\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1340\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1394\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1489\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1574\r\n* https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1992",

Despite having an extensible completions system, newbies to Click may decide to leave the package rather than write their own extension. It pushes new people away from using Click.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should abandon the version check and return to choosing an option in the [shell script](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/43e40c05a4b94c6aa497dc7bba62b7d69b7e35ec/src/click/_bashcomplete.py#L29) ?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe it's worth adding a small package to the click-contrib that would patch the original BashComplete ?\r\nI can do it if needed.\r\n",

I would suggest to add an additional `executable` flag that would check if the executable bit is set for the file or directory the path points to.\r\n\r\nThis surely can be achieved via a custom type, but it seems to me that this would be a valuable extension of `click.Path` as it would lead to all three access modes being checkable via click.  \r\nI am happy to contribute to an implementation, if there is any interest in this.",

You still want to show ETA, but you know that the automatic way *Click* is calculating this ETA is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nIn my personal use case, I have statistics on each task on how long it normally takes, so I can calculate ETA **historically** pretty easy.\r\n\r\nProposed Syntax\r\n===========\r\n```python\r\nimport click\r\n\r\n\r\n@click.command()\r\ndef my_command():\r\n    with click.progressbar(length=20) as bar:\r\n        for i in bar:\r\n            time.sleep(0.5)\r\n            bar.eta = eta_in_seconds\r\n```",

      "body": "This is a follow-up on #1449.\r\n\r\n> To get an overview of a program's usage, it would be helpful to print help for all commands at once rather than having to run, e.g. `script.py command1 --help`, `script.py command2 --help`, etc.\r\n> \r\n> This feature is important because the default top-level help doesn't indicate which commands have options, so it doesn't give a good overview of the program's functionality.\r\n\r\nCounting the related questions and answers on the Web, there is significant interest to provide a solution for this problem.\r\n\r\n## Solution Example\r\n\r\nBased on the [approach from SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57810659/), this could be a fully working solution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef all_help(ctx, param, value):\r\n    \"\"\"Show usage for all commands and exit.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def collect_help(cmd, parent=None):\r\n        ctx = click.core.Context(cmd, info_name=cmd.name, parent=parent)\r\n        if parent:\r\n            click.echo()\r\n        else:\r\n            ctx.help_option_names.remove('--help')\r\n        click.echo(cmd.get_help(ctx))\r\n        commands = getattr(cmd, 'commands', {})\r\n        for sub in commands.values():\r\n            collect_help(sub, ctx)\r\n\r\n    if value:\r\n        collect_help(ctx.command)\r\n\r\n\r\n@click.group(click.utils._detect_program_name(), invoke_without_command=True, no_args_is_help=True)\r\n@click.option(\"--help\", is_flag=True, expose_value=False, callback=all_help, help=all_help.__doc__)\r\ndef main():\r\n    \"\"\"Your CLI application starts here.\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above implementation shows the simple help screen (group help) when invoked w/o arguments and the full help screen with `prog_name --help`.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the clutter of the resulting screen, the `--help` option of all subcommands is suppressed. The above solution saves us from adding `@click.help_option(hidden=True)` decorators on each command.\r\n\r\n## Criticism\r\n\r\nThe verbose argument list in the `@click.group(...)` decorator is not particularly elegant, be but it's unfortunately needed to:\r\n\r\n- suppress an `Error: Missing command.` when using `--help` on the main group, and\r\n- display the correct `prog_name` for all commands in the help screen (the name of the group _function_ is used, otherwise).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nProbably the simplest thing to do would be to add the above code sample to the Click documentation. Potential places:\r\n\r\n- [Options](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/options/) chapter\r\n- [Commands and Groups](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/commands/) chapter\r\n- [Examples](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/quickstart/#screencast-and-examples) in Quickstart\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we turn the above code into a decorator and add it to the Click code base.\r\n\r\nWould you be open for a PR on either extending the docs or adding a decorator as explained?",
